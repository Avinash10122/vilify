Vilify
======

You are a mad scientist whose dream is to destroy the world. After many years of work, your doomsday device is almost ready -- and the end is set for tomorrow. Unfortunately, your stupid cronie, who you fired yesterday (he spilled your explosion potion, setting your plans back by at least a week), let it slip that the end is coming. Now Super Heroes from around the world are heading to your base with one goal -- to stop you for good. (Why can't they mind their own business? You're only trying to destroy the world!) Now it's your turn. It's time to send those heroes back where they came from!

## Developer Guidelines:

### Game Rules:
Before you do anything else you should [read the game rules](https://github.com/Logi0/vilify/wiki/Game-Rules). This will show you what we are trying to develop. Also you should check it regularly for any updates.

### TODO
1. Make `Button` object that extends `Entity` (It's technically an entity anyway).
2. Implement `InputManager` (thinking of "registering" entity to `InputManager`, so it knows who to pass event to).
3. Make bunch of Game objects (including: `Tower`, `Monster`, `Potion`, `Hero`, `DoomsdayDevice`).
4. Maybe separate AI object?
5. Implement `SpriteManager.addImage` exculsively for images. (I, zento, don't like those finicky `ctx.drawImage`).
6. Implement basic gameplay screen.
7. Implement `Sidebar` object.
7. Cross out (don't delete) each item when you are done. More to come.
