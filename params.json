{"name":"Vilify","tagline":"An Open Source HTML5 Game","body":"Vilify is made by the [Codecademy HTML5 Game Development Group](http://www.codecademy.com/groups/html5-game-development).\r\n\r\n# You are a mad scientist, \r\nwho has just completed a doomsday device! In 24 hours the device will erupt, destroying the world! Unfortunately, those pesky Super Heroes have discovered your evil plan, and now they are invading your lab! (Why can't they just mind their own business for once! All you are trying to do is only destroying the world!) Now you must build electronic defense towers, mix poisonous potions, and raise the dead! Protect your lab!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# How to Play Vilify\r\nDownload the project, extract the files and open `index.html` in a modern web browser.\r\nWhen Vilify is completed it will be put online for all to play.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Want to Help?\r\nFirst you will need to be added as a collaborator.
